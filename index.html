      <h2>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned <br class="break"> were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I <br class="break"> honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.</h2>
      <p>‚ÄúI was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a <br class="break"> transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for <br class="break"> the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 <br class="break"> weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I‚Äôve <br class="break"> successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.‚Äù</p>

      <h2>The team was very <br class="break"> supportive and kept me <br class="break"> motivated</h2>
      <p>‚ÄúI started as a total newbie with <br class="break"> virtually no coding skills. I now work <br class="break"> as a mobile engineer for a big <br class="break"> company. This was one of the best <br class="break"> investments I‚Äôve made in myself.‚Äù</p>

      <h2>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp <br class="break"> themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from <br class="break"> their experiences was easy.</h2>
      <p>‚ÄúThe staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The <br class="break"> program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present <br class="break"> myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the <br class="break"> personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people.‚Äù</p>

      <h2>Such a life-changing <br class="break"> experience. Highly <br class="break"> recommended!</h2>
      <p>‚ÄúBefore joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve <br class="break"> never written a line of code. I needed <br class="break"> some structure from professionals <br class="break"> who can help me learn programming <br class="break"> step by step. I was encouraged to <br class="break"> enroll by a former student of theirs <br class="break"> who can only say wonderful things <br class="break"> about the program. The entire <br class="break"> curriculum and staff did not <br class="break"> disappoint. They were very hands-on <br class="break"> and I never had to wait long for <br class="break"> assistance. The agile team project, in <br class="break"> particular, was outstanding. It took <br class="break"> my learning to the next level in a way <br class="break"> that no tutorial could ever have. In <br class="break"> fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during <br class="break"> interviews as an example of my <br class="break"> developent experience. It certainly <br class="break"> helped me land a job as a full-stack <br class="break"> developer after receiving multiple <br class="break"> offers. 100% recommend! ‚Äù</p>
